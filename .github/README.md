- `.github`  contains GitHub-specific files such as `CODEOWNERS`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, `README.md`, and various policies (security, code of conduct, etc)
- `src` contains the actual code


# Todo
- Have the categorisation text be inside the grey staionery list background
- Make copied to clipboard message nicer

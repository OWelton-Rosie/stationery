# WHS stationery list generator

## Directory breakdown
- `.github`  contains GitHub-specific files such as `CODEOWNERS`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, `README.md`, and various policies (security, code of conduct, etc)
- `src` contains the actual code

## Branches
- [`main`](https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/stationery/tree/main) - contains the latest, stable release.
- [`tests`](https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/stationery/tree/tests) - all PRs and commits should first be made here.
- [`best-practice-mgration`](https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/stationery/tree/DEPRECATED%5D-best-practice-migration) - was used when I was refactoring the CSS and JS to follow best practices. No longer updated.


# Todo
- ~~Have the categorisation text be inside the grey stationery list background~~
- Make copied to clipboard message nicer

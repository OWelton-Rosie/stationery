# Installation
There are two ways to run the project - creating the server with Python, or, for VSCode users, using the Live Server extension. 

## Option 1 - create the server with Python
First, clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/stationery/
```

Secondly, navigate to the project
```
cd stationery
```

If you're using Python 3: 
```
python3 -m http.server
```

If you're using another distribution of Python:
```
python -m http.server
```

This will open index.html on [http://localhost:8000/src](http://localhost:8000/src/). 


## Option 2 - use Live Server (VSCode only)
First, clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/stationery/
```

Second, open the project in VSCode

Third, [install Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (assuming you don't have it already) 

Finally, right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"

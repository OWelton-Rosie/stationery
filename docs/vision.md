# My vision for the project

The spark for this project came from a simple, totally unrelated moment — sitting with family, enjoying Friday night kebabs, and lamenting about how frustrating using the existing PDF provided by WHS. I realised that there wasn’t a tool that made this process easy and intuitive. I wanted something that I would actually use - an app that was practical, simple, and reliable.

From that small idea, the project began to take shape - both in my mind and on the laptop (I did next to no planning before commencing the project!). What started as a personal solution quickly grew into something with much bigger potential - a tool that could help students, teachers, whānau to stay organised.

Ultimately, I started this project because I saw an opportunity to make a positive difference in a small but meaningful way. My hope for the future is that this app will grow beyond my personal use into a resource the entire WHS community can depend on, including being officially endorsed by the school (I haven't looked into this, watch this space as it may change at some point!), maintained for years to come, and continually improved to meet the needs of students, teachers and whānau. 

I envision a future where it not only simplifies school life but becomes a tool that fosters organisation, efficiency, and a little less stress for everyone who uses it.

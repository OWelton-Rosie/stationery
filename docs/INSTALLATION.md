# Installation
- While this program was designed for Wellington High School, it can be adapted to suit the needs of your school.
- While I am happy to help configure the program for you (please <a href="https://owelton-rosie.pages.dev/contact">contact me</a> to start this process), your school's IT team will also be able to set it up.
- Note that this guide is written for users who already have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Table of contents
This guide is split into the following parts:

- Getting started (cloning, obtaining the necessary dependancies, etc)
- Basic logic configuration
- JSON creation/editing

## Getting started
Prerequisites:
- Python 

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/stationery/
```

Navigate to it:
```
cd stationery
```

To open `index.html` on [http://localhost:4000/src](http://localhost:4000/src/), run the following command:
```
python3 -m http.server 4000
```

Note that this guide assumes you're using Python 3. If you're using Python 2, run this command instead:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4000 
```
This will open `index.html` on [http://localhost:4000/src](http://localhost:4000/src/).

### Now that you've got the server running locally, it's time to develop!

## Basic logic configuration
## JSON creation/editing

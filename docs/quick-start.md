This guide assumes that you are an experienced developer. Refer to the detailed installation guide if you need more information.  

# Get the project set up
- Clone and navigate to the project
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your Operating System.

# Run it locally
To bring the project up on [http://localhost:8000/src](localhost:8000/src), we will use Python to create a server.

Execute the following command: 
```
python3 -m http.server
```

If you're using a later version:
```
python -m http.server
```

Regardless of what distribution of Python you're using, you can bring the project down by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C in the terminal window.
